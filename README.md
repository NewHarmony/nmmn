Miscellaneous tools: nmmn
===================

Miscellaneous modules for:

* `astro`: astronomy
* `dsp`: signal processing
* `lsd`: misc. operations on arrays, lists, dictionaries and sets
* `stats`: statistical methods
* `plots`: custom plots
* `fermi`: Fermi LAT analysis methods
* `bayes`: Bayesian tools for dealing with posterior distributions
* `grmhd`: tools for dealing with GRMHD numerical simulations

These are modules I wrote which I find useful -- for whatever reason -- in my research.

# Installation

The command line script can be installed via

    python setup.py install

You may need to run the last command with `sudo`.

Install the package with a symlink, so that changes to the source files will be immediately available:

    python setup.py develop



# TODO

* [x] repackage into public and private modules
* [x] install instructions
* [x] license
* [x] requirements
* [ ] possibly broken intra-package references? let's see
* [ ] pretty documentation with Sphinx

# License

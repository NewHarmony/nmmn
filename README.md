Miscellaneous tools: nemmen
===================

Miscellaneous methods for:

* astronomy
* signal processing
* misc. operations on arrays, lists, dictionaries and sets
* statistical methods
* custom plots
* Fermi LAT analysis methods

These are methods I wrote which I find useful -- for whatever reason -- in my research.

# Installation

The command line script can be installed via

    python setup.py install

You may need to run the last command with `sudo`.

Install the package with a symlink, so that changes to the source files will be immediately available:

    python setup.py develop

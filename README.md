Miscellaneous tools: nemmen
===================

Miscellaneous modules for:

* `astro`: astronomy
* `dsp`: signal processing
* `lsd`: misc. operations on arrays, lists, dictionaries and sets
* `stats`: statistical methods
* `plots`: custom plots
* `fermi`: Fermi LAT analysis methods
* `bayes`: Bayesian tools for dealing with posterior distributions

These are modules I wrote which I find useful -- for whatever reason -- in my research.

# Installation

The command line script can be installed via

    python setup.py install

You may need to run the last command with `sudo`.

Install the package with a symlink, so that changes to the source files will be immediately available:

    python setup.py develop



# TODO

* [x] repackage into public and private modules
* [x] install instructions
* [x] license
* [ ] requirements
* [ ] fix init with default methods
* [ ] possibly broken intra-package references? let's see

# License

See LICENSE file.

If you have suggestions of improvements, by all means please contribute with a pull request!  :)
